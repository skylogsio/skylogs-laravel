## 🚀 About Skylogs

**Skylogs** is an open-source, end-to-end **alert and incident management platform** built to bridge the gap between observability tools and incident response.  

It is designed with **shared responsibility** and **personalization** in mind, making it a flexible platform for use across all teams in an organization.  

Skylogs consolidates alerts from multiple observability systems, applies intelligent routing and escalation, and ensures the right people are notified through their preferred communication channels.  

👉 Our belief: **Incident response is not only an infrastructure concern — it’s an organizational responsibility.** Skylogs helps implement this mission by giving every team the tools they need to act quickly and effectively.
